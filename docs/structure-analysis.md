# Repository Structure Analysis

## Overview
This repository appears to be a scaffold for the "小靈芽 AI 好友通訊錄" project. Documentation and configuration files describe a full-stack application that should include React front-end code and Supabase backend resources. However, the committed tree currently only contains meta-files (README, LICENSE, configuration stubs) and lacks the actual source directories (`src/`, `backend/`, `public/`, etc.) that the documentation references.

## Documented Architecture
- **Front-end expectations**: `index.html` loads a React entry point from `/src/main.tsx`, and `components.json` is configured for shadcn/ui component generation targeting `src/index.css` and aliasing `@/components`, `@/lib`, and `@/hooks`. The README also outlines an expected `src/` hierarchy with components, contexts, hooks, and lib utilities.
- **Backend expectations**: Both the README and `GITHUB_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` describe a `backend/supabase` directory containing Edge Functions and database schema files. No such directory is present.
- **Documentation assets**: README references additional documentation under `docs/` (e.g., `docs/FAQ.md`), as well as screenshots and deployment guides that are not currently tracked.

## Actual Repository Contents
- Root configuration (`package.json`, `tsconfig*.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `eslint.config.js`) suggests a Vite + React + TypeScript project scaffold.
- `index.html` provides a minimal HTML shell but references the missing `src/main.tsx` bundle.
- `dist-example.html` references built assets under `/assets/`, indicating that a build artifact once existed, but the asset files are not in the repository.
- No application source files, backend scripts, or documentation directories described in the README are present.

## Key Gaps and Risks
1. **Missing source code**: Without the `src/` and `backend/` directories, the project cannot be built or run. `pnpm dev` or `vite build` would fail immediately.
2. **Inconsistent documentation**: README and upload guide promise artifacts that are absent, which can mislead collaborators or users attempting to evaluate the project.
3. **Potentially stale build artifact**: `dist-example.html` references hashed asset filenames that are not committed, suggesting incomplete deployment instructions or missing build output.

## Recommendations
1. **Restore the full codebase**
   - Commit the actual front-end source tree and backend assets described in the documentation.
   - Verify that `index.html` correctly references the entry point (`src/main.tsx`) and that the Vite project builds successfully after restoration.
2. **Align documentation with repository reality**
   - Until the code is restored, update `README.md` and `GITHUB_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` to clarify which parts are available and which are pending.
   - Provide accurate setup instructions based on the committed files to avoid confusion for contributors.
3. **Add verification steps**
   - Include CI checks (e.g., GitHub Actions) that attempt to run `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` so missing directories or files are caught before merging.
   - Consider adding a checklist in the contribution guide ensuring required directories and environment files exist before release.
4. **Bundle deployment artifacts explicitly**
   - If `dist-example.html` is intended as a reference deployment, include the corresponding asset files or document how to reproduce them.
   - Otherwise, remove or relocate the file to avoid implying a complete distribution bundle.

Clarifying these points will make the repository actionable for collaborators and align expectations between documentation and the actual codebase.
